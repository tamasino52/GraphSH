## Introduction

We evaluate models for 3D human pose estimation on the [Human3.6M Dataset](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/).

In this repository, only 2D joints of the human pose are exploited as inputs. We utilize the method described in Pavllo et al. [2] to normalize 2D and 3D poses in the dataset. To be specific, 2D poses are scaled according to the image resolution and normalized to [-1, 1]; 3D poses are aligned with respect to the root joint. Please refer to the corresponding part in Pavllo et al. [2] for more details. For the 2D ground truth, we predict 16 joints (as the skeleton in Martinez et al. [1] and Zhao et al. [3] without the 'Neck/Nose' joint). For the 2D pose detections, the 'Neck/Nose' joint is reserved. 


## Quickstart

This repository is build upon Python v3.8 and Pytorch v1.9.0 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. All experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) for other dependencies. We recommend installing Python v3.78 from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and installing Pytorch (>= 1.9.0) following guide on the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/) according to your specific CUDA version. Then you can install dependencies with the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/tamasino52/GraphSH.git
cd GraphSH
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Benchmark setup
CPN 2D detections for Human3.6M datasets are provided by [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D) Pavllo et al. [2], which can be downloaded by the following steps:

```
cd dataset
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/video-pose-3d/data_2d_h36m_cpn_ft_h36m_dbb.npz
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/video-pose-3d/data_2d_h36m_detectron_ft_h36m.npz
cd ..
```

3D labels and ground truth can be downloaded
```
cd dataset
gdown --id 1P7W3ldx2lxaYJJYcf3RG4Y9PsD4EJ6b0
cd ..
```

### GT setup 

GT 2D keypoints for Human3.6M datasets are obtained from [SemGCN](https://github.com/garyzhao/SemGCN) Zhao et al. [3], which can be downloaded by the following steps:
```
cd data
pip install gdown
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ac-gUXAg-6UiwThJVaw6yw2151Bot3L1
python prepare_data_h36m.py --from-archive h36m.zip
cd ..
```
After this step, you should end up with two files in the dataset directory: data_3d_h36m.npz for the 3D poses, and data_2d_h36m_gt.npz for the ground-truth 2D poses.

### GT Evaluation
